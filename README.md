First of all, a brief message about my trajectory in programming in React Native. I started creating App in React Native in the first week of April of the year 2020 when the lockdown started and I was at home with no job and nothing to do. So today it's been about 5 months since I started. As I have a degree in mechanical engineering, I had never studied a programming language in depth, so, before that, I didn't know anything about JavaScript, Node.js, Firebase, etc. So all the knowledge I have now was acquired in these months, so it is possible to do much better thus, feel free to comment or give your opinion, I will be glad.

### How to install
**It's a _React Native_ project**

 - To execute the project just download and extract the .zip
 - Inside the folder via console, run 'npm i' to install the project's dependencies.
 - Emulate an android device or an iOs device on your computer, I usually use only [Android Studio] (https://developer.android.com/studio#downloads).
 - After installing all dependencies and opening the emulator, run 'npx react-native run-android' for android and 'react-native run-ios' for iOS.
 - After the build it might occure a bug in Android Studio with the build in which when the app opens the screen is all white and the app is not loaded. Just close the application processes on the emulator and open it again and the app will load correctly.

### How the App works:

The App loads a SplashScreen where it seeks for a current User, if no user it navigates to log in screen, otherwise it loads the menu, every item is saved on Firebase back-end which is loaded as well. The user can place an order but he will need to set his address to be able to send his order, so the app navigates to set the user's address. After that, he is able to check his order and send to the seller so on. 

The User has screen where he can check for old orders and his points in the loyalty plan. 

I already have the seller App, where you can check for every users orders but the UI and the security aren't ready yet so the code is private still. But it will be open as soon as possible.
